# Socket-and-UDP-chat-app
iForum and UDPForum with their modules (iChat, UDPChatter, uChatter and Authenticate) were the exercises for my students in 2014. In these apps they had to find out where the synchronization problems were.
iForum works with Socket (TCP) and UDPForum, as the name suggests, with DatagramSocket (UDP).
Both are in SWING (see include images).
